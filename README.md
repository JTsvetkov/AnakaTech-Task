# AnakaTech-Task
This is my solution to the task given by Anakatech.
All of the requirments are met. 

Some tips:
For every 5 second update of the ratings there is a console log ('updated').
For every minute change there is also a console log('change in ratings').
There is a setTimeout function that stops the updating after 5 minutes.

Thank you for visiting, have a great day! ^_^
